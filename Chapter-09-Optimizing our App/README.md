## Chapter-09-Optimizing our App

This is the 9th chapter which means we have already crossed half of the Namaste course and started diving into advanced concepts.

The first half of the chapter was about Why to use, How to create, Where to create and When to use Custom Hooks were explained. Difference between helper functions and custom hooks were discussed with examples. We created a helper function (filtering logic) and two custom hooks (check network connection and fetch API data).
Custom Hooks - 
It is similar to a normal javascript function which does some operation on the given data, but can use state and other react hooks to update the DOM (two-way binding). 
A custom Hook is a JavaScript function that begins with "use" word. It is not mandatory to begin the custom Hook name with "use", but without it, React would be unable to check for violations of the Hooks rules automatically. The second half of the chapter was about optimizing our app using lazy loading/ on demand loading mechanism. Instead of wrapping up 100's of component into one JS file, we can do on demand loading to avoid slow performance of our app. Mostly lazy loading is done in large scale application.
