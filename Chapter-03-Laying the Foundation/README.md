## Chapter-03-Laying the Foundation

This chapter was all about Babel/Polyfills and their usage were explained. Scripts were written for starting and building the app. Steps to install a npm package were walked through. JSX vs React.createElement() vs Components were discussed in depth. It was a truely knowledge heavy session with lot of new concepts and keywords.
I have listed down some of the topics which was taught in class:
- BrowserList
- Babel: It's a transpiler that is installed as a dependency which helps in converting our code into code that browser understands. 
- .babelrc file - We create this file where configurations like removing console etc. are done.
- Keys: Keys are used to give unique identity to elements in list. It's a good practice to give key when same element is repeated multiple times.
- React.createElement()
- JSX: syntax extension to JS. `JSX is NOT HTML inside React/JS`. 
- Components
- Composing Component/ Component Composition/ Function Composition
