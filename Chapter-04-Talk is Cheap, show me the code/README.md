## Chapter-04-Talk is Cheap, show me the code!!

So, after three full heavy sessions, we are here to start our learning journey by creating a "Food Ordering App". First, we created basic structure of the web application, then continued with working on creating layouts, components and data manipulation from the mock data. Detailed understanding on virtual DOM & Actual DOM, Reconciliation, diff algorithm, Props, Importance of unique key were discussed. Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in theory.md

Using this knowledge, I have created a food ordering app named "Food Picky" in this chapter. This chapter is the basic step and lots of enhancements needs to be done in the upcoming chapters.

Perk: You should know that Functional component is nothing but a normal JS function, and Props (properties) passed in Component are similar to the arguments passed in a normal JS function call and received by the function definition as parameters.

Keep Reacting & Keep Coding!!
