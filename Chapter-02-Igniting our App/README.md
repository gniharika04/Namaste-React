## Chapter-02-Igniting our App

Second class was about creating production-ready react app from scratch without using `create-react-app`. Production-ready app on the second day of a course ? Sounds interesting right !!? We started with the concept of bundlers (Parcel) was explained in detail.
We learnt here that React doesnot make our app fast and powerful alone itself. It requires lots of dependencies.
It needs other packages/helper , dependencies for speeding up the application, optimizing the code, improving the performance and lots more. We also learnt that there so many additional things performed by Parcel that helps in making our app faster. 
Some of them are: HMR, minification, optimization, code splittig, compression, consistent hashing algorithms and lot more again.
And you know what - "Parcel is BEAST" was filled in the chats of React-live-Course, and everyone learnt "Parcel is BEAST" from this day.

Keep Reacting and Keep Coding!!
