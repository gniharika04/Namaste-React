## Chapter-06-Exploring the world!!

Until last chapter, we were using mock data to render the UI. In this chapter, we learnt about working with real time data from the Web (Our world basically). Then, we covered different types of System Architectures - Microservices and Monolith, different approaches to fetch API and render in UI. Today's important concept was one of the basic React Hook i.e. useEffect. We tried using useEffect in all combinations and understanding it in depth. Importance of conditional rendering and Shimmer in UI were explained. A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (it's currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.

Perk: React is called react because it reacts to every state change and re-renders the component whenever there is a state change. Also useEffect is the best place to have an API call.

Keep Reacting & Keep Coding!! :P
