## Chapter-01-Inception

A big Hiiiii!! to all of you over here. We will start our journey with introduction session of the Namaste React Live Course. Everyone was so excited in the very first day of class. We started learning with by setting up environment which was clearly explained by Akshay. And finally we created our first Hello Program.

First, using only html, then we tried to implement the same through javascript. Finally, we created a simple hello world program using React. Everything was done without installing any package. Unlike other courses which starts with create-react-app as first session, we tried writing the react code from zero (used CDN's). It was a true inception session for transforming from ZERO to HERO in React.

```
React is just simple. Keep Reacting & Keep Coding!!
