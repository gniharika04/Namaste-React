## Chapter-05-Let's get Hooked!!

In this chapter we have learnt about "Hooks" and how we can import and export components in JS file. There are three ways of importing a component. After building layout of Food ordering app - "Food Picky", we continued by creating search bar by adding functionality of searching restaurant. We discussed about JS events here. Basic understanding of onChange event, why it doesn't work if we are changing value in search input. By giving this example Akshay explained how and why to use state variables instead of creating local variables. To update/ modify the variable's value we use 'useState' hook in React. Hooks are normal function in JS and we can easily import it from "react". Some of the hooks are - useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState etc. Later we'll learn how we can create custom hooks.

Also we displayed Restaurant cards using mock data , props and destructuring object.

Conclusion - Input doesnot work by creating local variables in React. We need state variables. React keeps these state variables in sync with UI. Please refer the theory and assignment part for more knowledge.
