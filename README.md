‚ù§Ô∏è Welcome to journey of learning React üôè

I will be documenting my learning react journey in this series.
This is a Namaste React Course from Zero to Hero by Akshay Saini (Founder of NamasteDev). This repository consists of Assignment, Code & Class Notes.
Being my first repository I will be updating here some amazing stuff.

So, Hii beautiful peeps out there! I'm Niharika and working as a React developer in Wipro limited since 2 years. 
I'm rebooting myself with all the skills required for pro frontend developer, so taken this opportunity of learning react from Namaste React. Also in a road map to soon become a full stack developer.
The core concepts, deep knowledge of like why react is fast, how behind the scenes your app is performing, how browser responds to those changes are provided here.
So let's learn together and grow together.

Some important points to be remembered while cloning this respository.
Ater successful cloning, please follow below instructions:
 - I have given path for running app in package.json file inside "scripts", you can change it as per your convenience and run npm run start.
 - Also you can change port number or remove if app in not running in given port number
 - If you want to use direct command "npx parcel <entry point>"to run app, then remove "start" and "build" from "scripts". Just give npx parcel <entry point>
